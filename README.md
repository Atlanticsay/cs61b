  # CS61b
The course contents and homework of Berkeley CS61b.

The first half of the labs are the 18-spring version (https://sp18.datastructur.es/), 
while the rest of the hws and projects are from the 19-spring version (https://sp19.datastructur.es/).
For the 18sp version, the public can use the Gradescope to submit, check and grade their codes (see the homepage of 18-spring for more info).

Personally, I would recommend the hw, labs and projects in the 19 spring version. There were some featured revision and improvements based on the 18-sp version.
